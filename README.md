ArkDev-Training

Task 01:
Exercise on managing activities and intents

Task 02:
Originally it was an exercise on using recycler view. Task 02 was enhanced later with what I've learned from using other tasks and became an exercise to use the Glide library and Retrofit to add some networking functionality as a way to get used to working with those libraries.Task02 uses The Movie DB API which can be found at: https://www.themoviedb.org</br>

Task 03:
Simple exercise on using async tasks. The app just adds two numbers, which of course you wouldn't need asynctasks for that, but it's just an exercise.

Task 04:
Exercise on using asynctasks to communicate with an online service and parse the JSON response.

Task 05:
Simple exercise to use shared preferences.
